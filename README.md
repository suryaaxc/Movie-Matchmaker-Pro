📌 Project Overview
Movie Matcher Flex is not just a standard recommendation tool; it is a demonstration of handling Big Data in a production environment. While most systems struggle with latency at scale, this engine is optimized to deliver sub-second similarity matching across a massive 2.1 GB dataset.

🏗️ Engineering Architecture
To manage a project of this scale, several advanced engineering practices were implemented:

Scalable Vectorization: Utilized TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to transform 32M+ text-based features into high-dimensional vectors for precise matching.

Optimized Similarity Search: Implemented Cosine Similarity algorithms tuned for performance, ensuring the "Professional Edition" UI remains responsive under heavy data loads.

Large File Storage (Git LFS): Managed the storage and versioning of the 2.1 GB movies.csv file using Git LFS, overcoming standard GitHub file size limitations.

Production-Ready Deployment: Orchestrated on Streamlit Cloud with a dedicated Production Environment, featuring automated deployment pipelines from the main branch.

🎨 UI/UX: The Neon Experience
The application features a custom Neon-Themed Interface branded as the "Ultimate Matching | Professional Edition."

Sidebar Navigation: Clean search functionality for seamless movie discovery.

Real-time Feedback: Designed to provide instant recommendations even when processing millions of data points.
